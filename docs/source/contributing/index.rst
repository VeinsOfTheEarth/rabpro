Contributing
============

We welcome all forms of user contributions including feature requests, bug
reports, code, and documentation requests - simply open an `issue
<https://github.com/jonschwenk/rabpro/issues>`_.

Note that *RaBPro* adheres to `Black code style
<https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and `NumPy-style docstrings
<https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard>`_ for
documentation. We ask that contributions adhere to these standards as much as
possible.  For code development contributions, please contact us via email to be
added to our slack channel where we can hash out a plan for your contribution.
